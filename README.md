# Self-driving-car-Unity
 This project includes a 3d streets simulation for neural network's pre-training in C# and Python. We use a Perlin Noise algorithm to generate life-like cities with traffic lights, 
 road signs and more. Unfortunatelly we are shorted in resources and time, so our neural netrwok is detecting only few objects and landscapes are easy, but perfection takes time. That's gonna be fun to complete.
